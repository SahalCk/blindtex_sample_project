# blindtex

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

-I have used Bloc State Management to manage states across this application.
-I have used SharedPreference to store is Already loggedin the user,So that if the user once loggedin by entering the username and password, next time onwards he can directly go to home screen without login
-I have used Flutter Secure Storage to store token, so that it will be secured
-I have used Connectivity plus package so that if we are in log in page and No internet connection it will notify.
-I have used http package to manage APIs.
